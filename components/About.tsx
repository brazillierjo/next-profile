            üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è As a Web Developer since 2020, I thoroughly enjoy working with React & NextJs in an Agile environment,
            adhering to clean code principles, and implementing CI/CD pipelines. I take pleasure in transforming mockups
            of various styles into dynamic and interactive websites to enhance the user experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            üìö I initially stopped studying after completing a Technological Baccalaureate. From odd jobs to odd jobs, I
            quickly realized that this context would not be enough for me. So, at the age of 21, I decided to resume my
            studies and pursue a degree in e-commerce.
          </p>

          <p>
            üèãÔ∏è These studies allowed me to work as an SEO specialist for 6 years. This experience taught me about the
            functioning of the professional world, teamwork, the weight of responsibilities, as well as managing a back
            office and search engine optimization.

          </p>

          <p>
            üçÄ As an SEO specialist, working closely with developers sparked my interest in this highly technical field.
            Therefore, I enrolled in a 6-month bootcamp training program to acquire the fundamentals of web programming
            and coding. Following that, I continued my learning journey through an apprenticeship program, pursuing a
            degree in Web and Mobile Applications Integration/Development with a specialization in React and Node.js.
          </p>

          <p>
            üçæ Since then, I have worked with several companies on complete integrations, provided assistance to deliver
            projects on time, made modifications, and added new features...
          </p>

          <p>
            üë∑ Today, drawing strength from my journey, I master the intricacies of the Agile methodology, the
            principles of Clean Code, and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring optimal scalability and maintainability for each web
            application I develop. My diverse experience, spanning from SEO to programming, enables me to bring a unique
            perspective to every project.
